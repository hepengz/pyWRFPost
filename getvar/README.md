# getvar

#originvar
originvar is designed to do file IO and load the original data directly from the WRF output files.

#interpvar
interpvar will interpolate the data to the mass-center point of the grids, or other kinds of gridded data like pressure axis or hight axis.

The interpolation functions are needed, so there may be a file like interp.py sometime later, or just inside the interpvar.py.

#projectvar
Vectors need to be rotated or ajusted because of the map projection.

The functions to do projection are assigned to project.py.
